        "Unistellar has created the Enhanced Vision Telescope (eVscope), a compact telescope that amplifies light so users can see hundreds of nebulae and galaxies directlythrough its electronics eyepiece. It can also pinpoint and identify objects in the sky, making amateur astronomy fun and more accessible to the public. Thanks to itssensitivity and accuracy, the eVscope is a powerful tool able to generate data that can be used by scientists to search for transient events like supernovae, near-Earthasteroids, and comets. This constellation of small, & smart telescopes could also enhance and supplement data generated by the small number of large telescopesoperating today. Unistellar initiated a partnership with the SETI Institute to identify and implement scientific applications for a network of eVscopes. We summarizein this article the technology behind the eVscope and its real-time data processing (Enhanced Vision, Automatic Field Detection), then show several applicationsaccessible to future users, including asteroid occultations, the detection of the atmosphere of Pluto and observations of near-Earth asteroids. The Unistellar networkhas the potential to make citizen astronomy a popular reality by offering all users (new or experienced) a tool to explore the night sky with a powerful and reliableinstrument while they contribute to scientific investigations."

        "Astronomy is well served by the Internet; a Google search for “astronomy” in July 2012 returned over 100 × 106 results. The web sites most frequently visited range from online magazines and blogs to observatories and space missions. The Internet has a lot of information and resources for students and for informal adult learners, but we saw the value in creating a “one-stop-shop” for educational astronomy content. The Teach Astronomy site ( (uri: http://www.teachastronomy.com)) fills a unique niche because it offers multimedia materials spanning the entire subject and created by professional astronomers. The core resource is a set of articles derived from the introductory textbook called The Universe Revealed by Chris Impey and Bill Hartmann. Additional materials include video clips explaining all topics of astronomy, a set of astronomy encyclopedia articles from Wikipedia, images from Astronomy Picture of the Day, daily podcasts from 365 Days of Astronomy, and an RSS feed of recent Space and Time news articles from Science Daily. This paper describes the audience, materials, and the educational uses of Teach Astronomy. Figure [1] shows the traffic on the web site during its first year and a half of development.\n",

The project will take users through a series of quests to explore the regions of the night sky, and the objects within, defined from the eighty-eight constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. Explorer badges will be awarded on a \"gravity point\" system of successful observing missions, encouraging the practice of real astronomical observing, data handling and image processing practices, and comprehensive content research.

At present, there is no mechanism for schools to collect and share real data between classrooms and schools in an organized way. The proposed innovation allows users to communicate via a global network and is capable of being paired with an unlimited variety of scientific instruments and data sources, to support versatile, engaging, coordinated, multi-school experiments and data sharing. Data science now impacts virtually every profession in some way, and the platform will uniquely expose students to big data analytics in an engaging and relevant way. In Phase 1, feasibility of approach was firmly established. Phase II objectives will be to expand the educational platform developed in Phase I to optimize national/global impact and support applicability to big data research as well as a range of sensors. Goals include to expand tools to view and analyze data, refine and expand curriculum, develop an Application Programming Interface and create software tools to manipulate and share data/curriculum.\n",

More specifically, each audio story will have embedded audio cues that lead to audio/visual comprehension questions, games and polls. The platform will include account management, student rostering, student progress monitoring, administrative dashboards and interactive teacher guides for using audio in the classroom. Studies show that both game-based learning and audio content increase motivation in students, however no studies examine the use of both game-based learning and audio together. The research conducted for this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use a qualitative design to best understand and describe how classroom teachers and students use and engage with the interactive audio platform. The goal is to conduct interviews with teachers and usability testing with students to ensure that platform features are engaging, feasible, easily integrated and demonstrate potential for intended educational outcomes.

Current research focuses on large-scale, state- or nationwide- analytics, which comes years too late and is too broad to be usable by individual teachers to help students. The focus of this high-risk research is to develop analytics about individual students for use by individual teachers in the classroom in real-time, and monitor progress of these analytics throughout the school year. Armed with these analytics, teachers will be able to better understand the strengths and limitations of their individual students, especially as compared to their classroom. Using machine learning and NLP, these new algorithms and processes will be able to better ascertain learning analytics such as student engagement, digital literacy, and off-task behavior, to list a few. The result: automatic, actionable analytics for teachers to assist students in achieving their full potential. This high-risk research will help to fill a void that exists in the ways teachers receive formative information about their students' online activity.

        "\n",
        "This SBIR Phase I project proposes the creation of a unique, art-centric e-learning platform aimed at sparking the interest of young learners in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This extensible software platform implements a new category of e-learning based on the ample body of research in educational psychology and technology that advocates the use of art and guided play to teach STEM. This project will test the hypothesis that an e-learning system based on scientific illustration sparks engagement and enhances learning in young students. With students disengaging from STEM at an increasing rate, it is critical to make more tools available to teachers that connect student with STEM. STEM-related fields will drive innovation in our economy for decades to come; opening new pathways to vastly broaden participation in STEM is critical to our economic future. This project also proposes the creation of an online community and marketplace supporting STEM education through this platform. This will connect teacher-to-teacher for sharing best practices in teaching science using art and can make a deep and broad impact on the way STEM is taught.\n",
        "\n",
        "Built on scientific illustration and coupled with a set of tangible user interface (TUI) devices that mimic scientific instruments, this e-learning platform brings student hand-drawn art to life, creating interactive lessons that correlate to Next Generation Science Standards. As this system will be extensible and customizable, a major part of the R&D effort will be to create an easy-to-use templating toolkit that any teacher can leverage to develop custom lessons in STEM. The Phase I goal will be to create a fully functioning product and assess this system in elementary school classrooms. This toolkit will be developed in collaboration with Curio Interactive?s educational partners, as well as the Pacific Science Center, where Curio Interactive is a startup in residence, to rapidly develop this system, continuously iterating the software with real testers, following agile development methods. One of this project?s objectives is to appeal to groups historically underrepresented in STEM. Because this platform will be visual and kinetic, highly affordable, and universally available via the web, the proposed platform will improve the equity and accessibility of learning science.\n",

Using both innovative single case study design and smartphone technology this research will test when students participate in the instructional intervention do they experience an increase in science relevance both for themselves and society and science learning? Working with teachers, four science units will be created and replicated over a three year period (with additional new schools, teachers, and students in each successive year). By the end of year three a larger field test will be conducted in which the intervention will be implemented in 40 classrooms in twenty treatment high schools affecting nearly 2,000 students representing diverse backgrounds (with matched control populations). The conduct of this work, from its design to implementation, will be jointly undertaken in Finnish schools with similarly aged students.\n"

        "Many powerful teacher-facing and student-facing resources now exist, resources whose efficacy has been demonstrated along several axes of merit, but which remain underutilized. Given the realities of most teachers' lives, this is not surprising. A plethora of options, currently disconnected and uncontextualized, confronts teachers looking for ways to bring active scientific inquiry into their classrooms.  Teachers simply lack the time to sort through this bag of isolated resources and make informed choices.  They may also worry, with some justification, that if technical or pedagogic issues arise, they and their students will be left in the lurch. Teachers may also be concenred that even successful completion of a particular lesson, downloaded from an arbitraily-selected website, may not actually enhance their students' scientific literacy, ability to think computationally and/or to reason scientifically.\n",

Additional investments of similar magnitude in classroom computers are also failing to yield maximal return. Powerful hardware is used merely as means to \"surf\" the internet, process documents, run isolated applications and interact with the school's learning management system. We have yet to unleash at scale the synergistic combination of constructivist pedagogy, modern digital technology and the vast quantities of unexplored scientific data now publically available.  Doing so would empower students not merely to learn about science, but to do science.\n",

Self-efficacy reflects confidence in the ability to exert control over one's own motivation, behavior, and social environment. These cognitive self-evaluations influence all manner of human experience, including the goals for which people strive, the amount of energy expended toward goal achievement, and likelihood of attaining particular levels of behavioral performance. Unlike traditional psychological constructs, self-efficacy beliefs are hypothesized to vary depending on the domain of functioning and circumstances surrounding the occurrence of behavior."

        "What is proposed is research and development of a novel type of online professional development course, one specifically designed for science teachers who want to bring exploration and analysis of publicly-available scientific data into their classrooms. Initially, the work would focus on astrophysical data and telescope images, including images obtained by student-controlled robotic telescope networks. These are resources that allow students to make their own astronomical discoveries.  Later the scope of the proposed package would be widened to include other fields of research including molecular biology, ocean science, neurobiology and materials science.\n",
        "This proposal is motivated by the following:\n",
        "1) The chronic shortage of young people interested in, and prepared for, careers in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (STEM);\n",
        "2) Evidence that Global Hands-On Universe activities centered on student exploration and analysis of research-grade astrophysical data (including analysis of images obtained by research-grade telescopes) increase student interest in STEM and improve performance on Common Core-aligned math tests. (See, Bass et al., Science Education and Civil Engagement, an International Journal, 7 (2) 121-131, 2015);\n",
        "3) The burgeoning public availability of research-grade data and images, albeit through search portals designed for use by professionals, as well as the under-utilization of such data by science teachers;\n",
        "4) The maturation of constructivist pedagogies, such as Modeling Instruction that emphasize guided inquiry as a primary mode of instruction in the sciences, as well as endorsement of those approaches by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS); and\n",
        "5) The recent availability of affordable, portable, light-amplification telescopes (eVscopes) whose images could potentially be shared among a large number of users. (See, Marchis et al., Unistellar eVscope: Smart, portable, and easy-to-use telescopes for exploration, interactive learning, and citizen astronomy, Acta Astronautica 166 23-28, 2020).\n",
        "The proposed R&D is intended to take advantage of the commercial opportunities afforded by this confluence of under-utilized resources and unmet needs. Course development will require significant technological innovation to overcome the current limitations of existing course-creation tools such as edX Edge Studio.  A well-designed and effectively-implemented course would have a large potential enrollment base, namely, many thousands of high school and two-year college teachers.  Accordingly, funding would allow the applicant small business to engage in R&D with significant level of technological risk but the promise of commercial success and substantial societal benefit.\n"

        "It is not clear what obstacles stand in the way of teachers bringing research-grade scientific data into their classrooms. Accordingly, the R&D work to be done in Phase I will first determine, through teacher interviews, whether and how an appropriately-designed online professional course, one that provides curated access to those resources, could overcome those obstacles.\n",
        "Phase I work will continue, in the light of what was learned in teacher interviews, with an iterative cycle of prototype online course development and user feedback, in accord with current models of agile product development. Foreseeable technical challenges likely to be encountered in designing and prototyping this unique online professional development course include: 1) providing a choice of paths for teachers taking the course, each requiring a different degree of prerequisite knowledge and/or different amounts of time; 2) compiling a library of student-facing content modules, some pre-existing but in need of curation, others developed de novo, each a portal to scientific research data with imbedded assessments that align module content with Common Core and NGSS performance expectations; and 3) online teacher support and videoconferencing opportunities with designated experts. A machine learning layer will monitor and inform all uses of course materials. For assessments requiring narrative responses, natural language processing may play a role.\n",
        "Some modules featured in the online course would connect teachers to current science missions, such as NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), through Unistellar’s anticipated citizen science network, providing objects of interest to teachers and students.  These modules, whose use would be facilitated by a carefully-engineered teacher-facing interface, would allow teachers and their students to explore and analyze real mission data.  Potentially, students and their teachers could use these portals to make publishable scientific discoveries.\n",
        "\n",
        "The integration of these features into an online professional development course for science teachers would appear to be unprecedented, and is likely to encounter significant unanticipated technical challenges. The choice of astrophysics and astronomy as the foci of the prototype product is intended to insure that the widest variety of challenges will have to be overcome, enhancing the applicability of the product to other areas of science education.\n",
        "\n",
        "The customer profile for proposed online professional development course is a public or private high school or a two-year community college seeking affordable ways to help their teachers engage student interest in STEM careers. Too often, students attending such institutions are alienated by traditional methods of instruction. Currently-available science education research suggests that student exploration and analysis of scientific data lends a sense of authenticity and ownership to course assignments and lab activities. It follows that facilitating teacher access to such resources would improve not just student outcomes, but also teacher morale and retention, a clear benefit to institutional customers.\n",
        "While the web abounds with lists of resources related to astronomy education, only a few afford visitors the opportunity to explore and analyze research-grade scientific data.  These include: the International Astronomical Search Collaboration, a project of Global Hands-On Universe, which mediates access to the Las Cumbres Global Telescope network; the online Laboratory for the Study of Exoplanets, produced for NSF by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; and two activities developed by the NASA/MSU-Bozeman CERES Project. None of the above provide imbedded assessments aligned with Common Core and/or NGSS proficiencies or incorporate constructivist approaches to student learning such as Modeling Instruction.\n",
        "Greater use of publicly-available scientific data would yield societal benefits as well, including: greater public understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry and wider participation in meaningful and productive citizen-science.\n"
